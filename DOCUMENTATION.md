# Hardware in Context

Different research on beehive monitoring to assess health and overall well being of bees has come up with different approaches to do so. The less intrusive approach discovered and enabled thanks to the rapid development of machine learning systems is based on acoustic signals emitted by bees. 

Our team set the goal to transfer the research foundations to a system available to everyone. Hence, we started to explore possibilities with current technologies to create a piece of hardware with a software running on it, to enable beehive monitoring for everyone. This led to our project utilising an Arduino Portenta with LoRa Vision Shield to train and deploy a machine learning model. To power the device we use 6V solar power panel and a 3.7 LiPo 800mAh rechargeable battery. The results are transmitted via LoRaWan to the open sourced platform TheThingsNetwork from where they can be forwarded to platforms like Azure IOT, AWS IOT or similar via API. The device is hidden in a 3D-printed box to protect it from weather conditions and provide a suiting environment for the classification task.

## Payload Formatter (The Things Network)

<aside>
üí° Messages get casted to bytes to send them via LoRa. Hence, a payload formatter is required to translate the incoming bytes back to string again.

</aside>

- Very simple decoder to transform bytes payload to string

```bash
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  // Decode plain text; for testing only 
  var predictions = String.fromCharCode.apply(null, bytes);
  var values = predictions.split(" ");
  return {
      Bees: parseFloat(values[0]),
      Noise: parseFloat(values[1])
      
  };
}
```

# Validation and Characterization

# Conclusion

### Summing up

Unfortunately, our prototype had to be trained on very simple data that allows it to classify between bees and noise, since only one paper found provided access to their data. We tried reaching out to a specific research group that collected data on varroa mite detection, but unfortunately they could not provide us with their data. 

Further, the model trained and used for this specific case needs adjustments for the aimed task, since the classification of e.g. mite infestation or queen abstinence is trickier because in those cases we compare bee sound with each other. To train a model like that, it would require enough data and enough computational time for training, as well as testing. Further, the more complex MFCC audio feature creation is required, since the utilised MFE feature creation in this project is only suitable for simpler tasks. 

Using the LoRa technology is very beneficial, but one has to keep in mind that it is a network based on other participants. Hence, it can happen that oneself has to setup the required gateway device to guarantee a consistent LoRa connection. 

Nevertheless, our prototype gives us a first proof of concept and shows the capabilities of modern technologies, accessible to everyone and many of them free as well. We have to point out the great performance of the classification task, especially considering the very small on board microphones of the Arduino Portenta H7 Vision Shield as well as the short training time (edge impulse free version only allows 20 minutes of computation time and 4GB of data storage).

### Future development

- Start real data collection to retrain model for different recognition tasks
    - Build online database
    - Differentiate between location, bee species and classification task
    - Fine-tune model on certain beehive(s) and task
- Provide possibility to transfer collected data directly from Arduino to S3 bucket
    - Build pipeline for continuous model training via edge impulse API
- Create API for Amazon AWS IOT Cloud or Microsoft Azure IOT Cloud integration
- Test external microphones for better quality and classification enhancement
