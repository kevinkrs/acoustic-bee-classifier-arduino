# Setup

## LoraWan

1. Get Arduino IDE
2. Connect Portenta H7 with Vision Shield to computer
3. Download `MKRWAN` library
4. Go to 
    
    `File > Examples > MKRWAN > MKRWANupdate_standalone`
    
5. Upload the code
6. Open serial monitor to check when ready 
    
    `Tools > Serial Monitor`
    

## Arduino Cli

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Shell client to communicate with connected Arduino board

</aside>

## Edge Impulse

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Platform for training machine learning algorithms and creating deployments specialised for small, low energy devices (Arduino, raspberryâ€™s, mobile etc.)

# Deploying scripts

1. Download the script files `.sh`
2. Go to file directory and run
    
    `sh flash.mac_command`
    
3. Run `edge-impulse-daemo` to start arduino

# Possibilites

- Detection if bee-hive has queen
- Detection of stress level
- Detection of varroa infection

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Creating ML models based on audio data can result in an non-intrusive way of bee-hive monitoring.

</aside>

- Little effort to set-up
- Comparably cheap (~200â‚¬ for hardware)
